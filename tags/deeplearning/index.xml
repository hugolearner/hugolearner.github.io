      <description>Cross Entropy Loss In a supervised learning problem for predicting classes, we predict probabilities for the classes. To determine how successful we are predicting the classes, we require a loss function.
Cross-Entropy loss function provides a loss function to calculate the loss between the actual classes and the predicted probabilities
This can be represented as
 Get the predicted probability of the class Get the actual label of the class ( 1 or 0 ) Multiply the actual label with the log of the predicted probability of the class Sum the values obtained from each of the classes Multiply by -1 the value obtained in Step 4  This is the loss for a single observation.</description>

      <description>Sigmoid function takes values between 0 and 1
$$ {sigmoid} = \frac {e^x} {( 1+ e^x )} $$
This is used in logistic regression.
The sigmoid graph is generated by the R code provided below.
Softmax function is used to calculate the probablities in multiple classes. Suppose we have a image of a digit. We want to calculate whether it is a 1, 2, 3, and so on. Softmax would provide the probablity for each of the classes.</description>
